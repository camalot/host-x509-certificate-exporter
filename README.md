# üîè X.509 Certificate Exporter

Inspired by [enix/x509-certificate-exporter](https://github.com/enix/x509-certificate-exporter) but added the ability to just hit a host to get the certificate info

A Prometheus exporter for certificates focusing on expiration monitoring, written in python.


Get notified before they expire:

- configure host name and port

Uses the same dashboard (with tweaks)

# METRICS

The following metrics are available:

- `x509_cert_not_before`
- `x509_cert_not_after`
- `x509_cert_expired`
- `x509_read_errors`


# CONFIGURATION

By default, it will load `/app/config/.configuration.yaml`. To change this, set the `X509_CONFIG_FILE` environment variable.

```yaml
metrics:
	# port to listen on for exporting
  port: 8932
	# how often to poll the certificates
  pollingInterval: 43200 # 12 hours
# hosts to check
hosts:
- name: server1.home.local
  port: 443
- name: server2.home.local
  port: 8443
- name: server3.home.local
  port: 10000
```
