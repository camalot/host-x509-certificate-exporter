# üîè X.509 Certificate Exporter

Inspired by [enix/x509-certificate-exporter](https://github.com/enix/x509-certificate-exporter) but added the ability to just hit a host to get the certificate info

A Prometheus exporter for certificates focusing on expiration monitoring, written in python.


Get notified before they expire:

- configure host name and port

Uses the same dashboard (with tweaks)
